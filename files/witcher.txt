To win this game, you must find and defeat all 5 bosses. After you defeat
a boss, you must type 'use itemName'
Do NOT actually type out itemName, type the name of the Item that 
the boss drops.
First, you need to move around rooms til you find a good enough weapon. 
Eat all food items along the way, building health. To use a potion, use
the command 'consume' instead of 'eat' like food items.
Once you have enough health, go find the first boss. (Should be level 50)
Type 
"engage 'name'" (name being the bosses name) to engage them. Then follow 
the menu to attack if you like, hopefully defeating them.Dont forget
to use the item they drop. And MAKE SURE you 
have a weapon in your inventory before attacking.
After some time moving around the area, a path should open up from the 
crossroads going north. Then you just repeat the same steps for each area,
hopefully defeating the final boss and winning the game.
